# üç∑ Wine Quality Prediction
Predict the quality of red wine based on physicochemical features using various regression models including Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest, and XGBoost. The project also includes hyperparameter tuning and model export capabilities.

## üìå About
This project aims to predict the quality of red wine based on several physicochemical properties such as pH, alcohol content, and acidity levels. The prediction task is approached as a regression problem using multiple models to evaluate performance and improve accuracy.

Key objectives:

Explore and visualize the dataset.

Train and evaluate multiple regression models.

Perform hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.

Export predictions and the best model for future use.
